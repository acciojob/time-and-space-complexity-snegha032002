	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms are essential for handling large datasets and ensuring optimal performance.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where n is the size of the input.</p>
